# Setup

To access all of the files I recommend you fork this repo and then clone it locally. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

The other option is to click the green "clone or download" button and then click "Download ZIP". You then should extract all of the files to the location you want to edit your code.

## Background Information

we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs
